when reading Backpropagation In Convolutional Neural Networks http://jefkine.com/general/2016/09/05/backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks/
there are two concepts : Cross-correlation  Convolution

To understand them, i have found some useful materials
1.http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/CMSC426/Convolution.pdf
2.http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~pardo/courses/eecs352/lectures/MPM14-Convolution.pdf
3.http://www.simon-hohberg.de/2014/10/10/conv-net.html
4.http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html
  describe what convolution is , including ï¬‚ipped the kernel, cross-correlation
