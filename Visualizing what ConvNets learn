one visualization technique: Retrieving images that maximally activate a neuron

  one paper develops such method: "Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation".
the core concept is R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. they solve the CNN localization problem by operating within the 
“recognition using regions” paradigm described by the paper "Recognition using Regions". In the paper "Recognition using Regions",
it use the "region tree" which is depicted by the paper "From Contours to Regions: An Empirical Evaluation"
