one visualization technique: Retrieving images that maximally activate a neuron

  one paper develops such method: "Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation".
the core concept is R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. they solve the CNN localization problem by operating within the 
“recognition using regions” paradigm 

  "Recognition using Regions".  use region tree
  "From Contours to Regions: An Empirical Evaluation"  develop region tree
