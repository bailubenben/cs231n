in NetworkVisualization-TensorFlow, it introduces SqueezeNet. it uses squeezenet1_0,has some difference from squeezenet1_1
  
when i have downloaded the weights about the model, there comesthere files: squeezenet.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001, 
squeezenet.ckpt.index, squeezenet.ckpt.meta. 

i don't know their relationship and not sure which one should be feed to the save_path in the initial step.Since it is written
by tensorflow, there are some introductions in  
http://cv-tricks.com/tensorflow-tutorial/save-restore-tensorflow-models-quick-complete-tutorial/

according to the tutorial, meta graph is a protocol buffer which saves the complete Tensorflow graph; i.e. all variables, 
operations, collections etc. This file has .meta extension. Checkpoint file is a binary file which contains all the values of 
the weights, biases, gradients and all the other variables saved. This file has an extension .ckpt. 
However, Tensorflow has changed this from version 0.11. Now, instead of single .ckpt file, we have two files: data file is 
the file that contains our training variables
