  in NetworkVisualization-TensorFlow, it introduces SqueezeNet. it uses squeezenet1_0,has some difference from squeezenet1_1
  
  when i have downloaded the weights about the model, there comesthere files: squeezenet.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001, 
  squeezenet.ckpt.index, squeezenet.ckpt.meta. 
  i don't know their relationship and not sure which one should be feed to the save_path in the initial step.Since it is written
by tensorflow, there are some introductions in  http://cv-tricks.com/tensorflow-tutorial/save-restore-tensorflow-models-quick-complete-tutorial/
