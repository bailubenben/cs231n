In the file **NetworkVisualization-TensorFlow**, i was stuck by Saliency Maps. Of course, i had read the paper  
[Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034) and the hint in the function **compute_saliency_map** and a lot of other 
explanationsand source codes. 

First, i felt lost about the loss described in such ways *"You should use the correct_scores to compute the 
loss, and tf.gradients to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the input image stored in model.image"*. 
But What is the loss? how to define the loss? does the so-called predict_scores exist? there is some difference 
about saliency maps between the paper and the hint.In the paper, it computes the the **derivative of the scores** 
**with respect to the image**, not the **loss w.r.t the input**. the difference confused me hardly. In the end, 
i choose to follow the definaton in the paper.

Then, it comes the implement

    1) got the gradient, scores w.r.t input image
    2) for RGB, took the absolute value of this gradient
    3) then took the maximum value over the 3 input channels. 
Logically, it seemed simple in the following. However, the problems sprung up. it was about tensorflow. yes, tf.abs was easy.
but with tf.reduce_max, how to assign axis? the document was not clear to me. i had to locate the source code about reduce_max.
find this link:

use jupyter notebook::
  
      from tensorflow.python.ops import gen_math_ops
      gen_math_ops??
  
here comes the source code::
  
      from tensorflow.python.framework import op_def_library as _op_def_library
      _op_def_library??
  
enjoy the trip, dig dig dig 

can't explain the the axis .........
